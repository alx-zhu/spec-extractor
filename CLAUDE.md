Instructions:
Always use conventional commits when making changes.
When starting a new change, create a new branch following conventional commits style, naming like: feat/create-action-button.
Never commit to the main branch unless explicitly instructed.

Before making code changes, you must ask questions for clarification if you are unsure at all of implementation details.
